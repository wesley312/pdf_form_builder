# PDF Form Builder

Some PDF form is not setup properly for us to fill in, and existing solution either require payment or need to upload your PDF to 3rd party server, hence the born of PDF Form Builder.

This project is based on PyMuPDF for PDF editting and tkinter for UI, and built entirely by Claude Sonnet 4.5.
